# Summary
Welcome candidates to the coding phase of the Trifecta Nutrition Technology Department interview. The intent of this 
phase is for you to demonstrate your coding skills and provide an example for the type of code you will generally be
creating as a member of this team. 

This is an "at home" assignment and you can use any resources you have available to you. That means you can research
whatever and wherever you want but please write your own code. Give an honest attempt and try not to plagiarize. 
Again, we are looking for a good solid example of the code you generally create. 
# The Process - in general
Listed below are the general steps that we expect you to follow. When you are ready to submit, making a pull
request will indicate to us that you feel the code is good to go and that we should take a look. Sending us an email
as a reminder will also help to get our eyes on your code. 

1. `git clone` the repository down to your local machine
2. `git checkout -b <branch name of your choice>` to create your development branch
3. Write code using your favorite IDE/editor and `git commit` on your solution
    - Feel free to create as many commits as you deem necessary
4. `git push` when you want update the github repository
5. Submit a pull request for your branch to indicate you feel you are done with the assignment

# The Requirements
The `Data` directory contains some information that we need exposed via a REST API. Using whatever language and/or
frameworks you are comfortable with, please provide a solution to access and perhaps manage that data via REST 
endpoints. Along with the code, if we need to follow special steps to get your code running, you may want to update
this README. It might be a good assumption to consider us as unaware of how to take your code and make it work.

These requirements are vague on purpose. If you need to make a design decision please do so, but remember we aren't
sitting next to you. Explanation for those design decisions may be required.
